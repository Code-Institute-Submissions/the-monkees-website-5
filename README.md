# The Monkees Website
This project is to create a new website solution for the band "The Monkees" 
which would showcase their new content for potential new fans, while also 
appealing to existing fans wanting to find out more about their favourite band.

The band has always had a 60's theme with their colours and style, which was 
incorporated into the design of this website. 

The band also requested that we enure that the social media was showcased as 
they are trying to create a strong social media brand awareness. 

## UX
This project was designed to fulfil several criteria as set out by the band. 
This included;

1. Balance the content between the two target audiences; new and existing fans
2. Showcase their music, images, and video clips
3. Promote their new services; weddings and christmas parties
4. Promote and help grow their social media

This website balances these goals perfectly as the content was designed to give 
a basic overview of the band, so as to not alienate new or existing fans or 
overload them with content. For newer fans, and devoted existing fans, we have 
included a timeline of the bands greatest achievements. To help newer fans identify
with the band, we have included a "meet the band" section on the home page with 
images of the band members. 

To help promote their new single, we have included this on the home page, as well 
as in the music page. The History page includes images of the band together, the 
previously mentioned timeline, and also a clip from the Monkees official YouTube 
channel with an interview with the band about their upcoming album. In the music 
section, we have included several of their top hits, which can be played directly
from the site and also YouTube videos of the band playing live.

To promote their new services, we have included a promo section on the home page 
as well as a full page of the site with details of these offerings. 

We have also included links to their social media in the nav bar and footer, so
that new and existing fans will see clearly that the band has these services and 
can click on them to link directly to these channels and follow the bands progress 
on all of their social media.
